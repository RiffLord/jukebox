JUKEBOX is a simple command line program, intended to propose listening suggestions
to users with large digital music libraries. The program reads the users collection
from a text file, selecting one at random and printing it on screen. A simple PowerShell
script is used to automatically generate the list of albums or directories containing music.
To aid the program, the number of items is included at the top of this file.
The program reads through the file, and generates a number less than or equal to the number
of items contained in the file. It subsequently identifies the corresponding album within the list
and prints it to the screen.

1. Open the file containing the list.
2. Read the first line to obtain the number of items.
    2a. Convert the string to an integer, x.
    2b. Generate a random integer between 1 and x + 1.
        The offset is to account for the fact that line 0 contains
        the number of albums. Therefore there are x + 1 lines of text
        in the file.
3. Find the line corresponding to x + 1 within the file and print it.
